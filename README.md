# Grocery-list-formating-tool
A CS-210 project that gathers text data and formats using C++ and Python

The Project takes a .txt file and formats the data in various ways using C++ and Python.
I feel like the Python code was well exicuted because that was the part that I spent quite a bit of time perfecting. 
The code could be made better and more efficent by streamlining some of the functions. I know there are better ways, but Im not familar enough to utilize them correctly. 
I would probably try using Pandas for Python. 
Formatting the text after putting it in a dictionary stumped me for a while and I had to reach out to some classmates to see how they had tackled the same problem.
The discord study server was amazingly helpful.
The skills of importing other data files into the program was exciting for me. I have another project that I am working on that I will be able to utilize this on. 
I tried to add comments everywhere and comparmentilize funtions so each operation was clear.
